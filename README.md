# Tailwind CSS Responsive Design Conflict
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS for complex responsive designs. The problem arises from conflicts in responsive directives (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, etc.) due to the order of classes in HTML elements.  The solution focuses on a more systematic approach to class ordering or employing utility-first design principles to achieve intended styling consistently across different screen sizes.
