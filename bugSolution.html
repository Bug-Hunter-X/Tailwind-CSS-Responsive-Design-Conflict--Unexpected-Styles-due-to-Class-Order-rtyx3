There are several ways to solve this problem:

**1. Re-order Classes:**  The simplest approach is to carefully reorder classes based on specificity and screen size.  Always apply higher-priority (larger screen sizes) styles last:

```html
<div class="xl:bg-green-500 lg:bg-blue-500 md:bg-red-500">
</div>
```
This approach makes the style logic clear to read. 

**2. Use More Specific Selectors:**  Tailwind's ability to target specific elements through `@apply` helps achieve clearer specificity.  Create a class with the desired combination:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 my-class">
</div>

<style>
.my-class {
  @apply md:bg-red-500 lg:bg-blue-500 xl:bg-green-500;
}
</style>
```
This keeps your component clean and the responsive logic centralized. 

**3. Employ a CSS Framework:** Integrate a CSS framework (outside of Tailwind's utility-first approach) such as Bootstrap that uses a different styling structure which can assist in resolving responsiveness conflict. However, this might not be an optimal solution because it will break the pure Tailwind style.
